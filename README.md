# CodeWars Desktop

This is just a quick and possibly dirty Electron app to allow quick and easy access to the CodeWars site. CodeWars-Desktop does not use code from the CodeWars site, but does act as a stripped down desktop browser to view the CodeWars site itself. While there are surely other apps like it this application was created purely for my own use case.

## Suggestions and Contributions

If you have any recommendations for changes by all means let me know! 

As for contributions, I do not mind if anyone submits PRs as long as it adds to the functionality, and does not remove the current functionality.
